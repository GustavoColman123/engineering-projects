# 555 LED Blinking Circuit

A simple LED blinking circuit using the NE555 timer in astable mode.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to understand:

- How the 555 timer generates oscillating signals
- The relationship between resistors, capacitors, and frequency
- Basic circuit debugging and troubleshooting

## Hardware

- NE555 Timer IC
- Resistors (1kΩ, 100kΩ, 220Ω)
- Capacitor (10µF)
- LED
- Breadboard
- 5V power supply

## System Design

The 555 is configured in astable mode, generating a continuous square wave.

- The capacitor charges through R1 and R2
- It discharges through pin 7
- This creates a periodic ON/OFF signal at pin 3

## Problems Encountered

- Power supply shutting down due to incorrect wiring
- Incorrect capacitor polarity preventing oscillation
- Misaligned connections in the breadboard
- LED appearing constant instead of blinking

## Lessons Learned

- Always verify power supply before debugging
- Build circuits step by step, not all at once
- Small wiring mistakes can break the entire system
- Understanding the circuit is more important than copying it


## Status

✔ Functional  
🔄 Next step: integrate with CD4017 for LED sequencing
